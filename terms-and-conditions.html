<h3 id="product-description">Product description</h3>
<p>Prices, descriptions or availability of Products are outlined in the respective sections of this Application and are subject to change without notice.</p>

<p>While Products on this Application are presented with the greatest accuracy technically possible, representation on this Application through any means (including, as the case may be, graphic material, images, colours, sounds) is for reference only and implies no warranty as to the characteristics of the purchased Product.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="order-submission">Order submission</h3>
<p>When the User submits an order, the following applies:</p>

<ul>
<li>The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.</li>
<li>In case the purchased Product requires an action from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.</li>

</ul>

<p>All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.</p>

<p>Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. In such cases related information can be found in the dedicated section of this Application.</p>

Therefore, this Application does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed. The User may read the privacy policy of this Application to learn more about the data processing and Users’ rights regarding their data.</p>

<p>If a payment through the available methods fails or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfil the purchase order. If a payment fails or is refused, the Owner reserves the right to claim any related expenses or damages from the User.</p>
<h3 id="purchase-via-app-store">Purchase via app store</h3>
<p>This Application or specific Products available for sale on this Application must be purchased via a third-party app store. To access such purchases, Users must follow the instructions provided on the relevant online store (such as "Apple App Store" or "Google Play"), which may vary depending on the particular device in use.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, purchases done via third-party online stores are also subject to such third-parties’ terms and conditions, which, in case of any inconsistency or conflict, shall always prevail upon these Terms.</p>

<p>Users purchasing through such third-party online stores must therefore read such terms and conditions of sale carefully and accept them.</p>
<h3 id="retention-of-product-ownership">Retention of Product ownership</h3>
<p>Until payment of the total purchase price is received by the Owner, any Products ordered shall not become the User’s property.</p>

Further conditions applicable to the trial period, including its duration, will be specified on this Application.</p>
<p>The trial period shall end automatically and shall not convert into any paid Product unless the User actively purchases such paid Product.</p>
<h4 id="fixed-term-subscriptions">Fixed-term subscriptions</h4>
<p>Paid fixed-term subscriptions start on the day the payment is received by the Owner and last for the subscription period chosen by the User or otherwise specified during the purchasing process.</p>

<h2 id="subscriptions-handled-via-apple-account">Subscriptions handled via Apple Account</h2>
<p>Users may subscribe to a Product using the Apple Account associated with their Apple App Store account by using the relevant process on this Application. When doing so, Users acknowledge and accept that</p>

<li>any payment due shall be charged to their Apple Account;</li>
<li>subscriptions are automatically renewed for the same duration unless the User cancels at least 24 hours before the current period expires;</li>
<li>any and all fees or payments due for renewal will be charged within 24-hours before the end of the current period;</li>
<li>subscriptions can be managed or cancelled in the Users’ Apple App Store account settings.</li>
</ul>


<p>The above shall prevail upon any conflicting or diverging provision of these Terms.</p>
<h4 id="automatic-renewal-of-fixed-term-subscriptions">Automatic renewal of fixed-term subscriptions</h4>
<p><strong>Subscriptions are automatically renewed through the payment method that the User chose during purchase.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The renewed subscription will last for a period equal to the original term.</strong></p>

<h5 id="termination-by-the-user">Termination by the User</h5>

<p><strong>If the notice of termination is received by the Owner before the subscription renews, the termination shall take effect as soon as the current period is completed.</strong></p>
<h4 id="termination-for-cause-and-or-impossibility-of-performance">Termination for cause and/or impossibility of performance</h4>
<p>The Owner expressly reserves the right to terminate the contract effective immediately for cause and/or impossibility of performance — such as, for instance, orders from public authorities, breach against statutory law or infringement of third-party rights, actual or impending insolvency, inappropriate use of this Application.</p>
<p>In particular, the Owner may terminate the contract with immediate effect should the User be a sanctioned person or entity, or be based in a sanctioned territory designated by an authority that the Owner is directly or indirectly subject to.</p>
<h4 id="statutory-rights-of-termination">Statutory rights of termination</h4>
<p>Any mandatory statutory rights of termination set out by applicable law shall remain unaffected.</p>
<h3 id="provision-of-personal-data">Provision of personal data</h3>
<p>To access or receive some of the Products provided via this Application as part of the Service, Users may be required to provide their personal data as indicated on this Application.

    </section>
    <section class="main__section section__user-rights">
      <h2 id="user-rights">User rights</h2>

<h3 id="right-of-withdrawal">Right of withdrawal</h3>
<p><strong>Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification. Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.</strong></p>
<h4 id="who-the-right-of-withdrawal-applies-to">Who the right of withdrawal applies to</h4>
<p>Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are European Consumers are granted a statutory withdrawal right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online (distance contracts) within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.</p>

<p>Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section. The Consumer shall only be liable to the Seller for any diminution in the value of the goods resulting from handling the goods in a manner other than that necessary to acquaint him with the nature, characteristics and functionality of the goods.</p>
<h4 id="exercising-the-right-of-withdrawal">Exercising the right of withdrawal</h4>
<p>To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>

<p>To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the “definitions” section of this document. Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way. In order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.</p>

<p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Regarding the purchase of a service</strong>, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>In case of purchase of a digital content not supplied in a tangible medium</strong>, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="effects-of-withdrawal">Effects of withdrawal</h4>
<p>Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>

<p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>

<p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User’s decision to withdraw from the contract. Unless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction. In any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>
<h5 id="on-the-purchase-of-services">…on the purchase of services</h5>
<p>Where a User exercises the right of withdrawal after having requested that the service be performed before the withdrawal period expires, the User shall pay to the Owner an amount which is in proportion to the part of service provided.</p>
